## 🧑🏽‍🚀 About Project Pi

Project Pi is a liquid-staking protocol built to make staking as secure and decentralized as possible. As a family of open-source, peer-to-system software tools, Project Pi is currently deployed and  on the PulseChain blockchain network.

The Project Pi protocol is governed by the Pi DAO - an independent collection of contributors, staking enthusiasts and governance participants 🧑🏽‍🚀
